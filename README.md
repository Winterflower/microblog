## Basic Flask microblog

This repository contains code from the [Flask microblog tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/tutorial/)

TODO:
show_entries.html template fails to load

Still hard:

* Understanding the logic of Jinja templates and how they relate to the functions in main Flask app

* SQLite 3...?

* how do I allow a user to click on buttons on the UI ?

* how do I learn to debug effectively ?
